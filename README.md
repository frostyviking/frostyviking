### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Sysadmin/network dude @ heart, started my route with tech/IT early 80s as a wee laddie.
Love anything tech, innovative, games, -IT floats my boat as one might say.

Fulltime employed and doing stuff on the side in my own business.
Fulltime dad with my kids -a lot of work, so much love.

Stay frosty.
